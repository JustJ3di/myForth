# myForth
My forth interpreter.
I like writing interpreters. I find parsing and interpreting languages very fascinating. I had already written an interpreter for inline Forth in C++. In C, I preferred to read the entire file and interpret it.
The language is concatenative and stack-based. Therefore, there is no real compilation phase. I got the idea from Antirez's (aka Salvatore Sanfilippo) YouTube videos
